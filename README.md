# Virtual Radiologist Project - KU Hackfest 2021

## Introduction

Virtual Radiologist is an application to detect pneumonia and brain tumor through X-ray with the help of AI. Many health cases are ignored because in the initial state, it is hard to identify it through X-ray. Detecting Pneumonia and Brain Tumor in the initial state could prove life-saver for patients suffering from it. For, this Deep-learning comes to play. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from the more commonplace single-hidden-layer neural networks by their depth.
