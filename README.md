# Virtual Radiologist Project - HACKTU 2.0

## Introduction

Virtual Radiologist is an application to detect pneumonia and brain tumor through X-ray with the help of AI. Many cases are ignored in the initial state, as it is hard to identify it through X-ray. Detecting Pneumonia and Brain Tumor in the initial state could prove life-saver for patients suffering from it. For, this Deep-learning comes to play. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from the more commonplace single-hidden-layer neural networks by their depth.
